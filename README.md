html-layout
===========

## Objective
Understand HTML and its uses in layout by completing a series of tasks

## Directions
Fork this repo then clone your fork onto your local machine. Inside each of the three folders you will find an image. That image is a representation of the layout you need to create using HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html and a style.css file. In the other folders, you'll need to add them yourself. *Your first step should be connecting your CSS sheet with your HTML sheet.* -->
